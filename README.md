# FramOS Graphing Reporting

The project module integrates various kind of graphing and reporting tools like pie chart, bar chart etc and enable the users to visualise all the farm harvest and animal data in real time

## Features:

- Proof of concept examples for harvest and animal modules which are used to represent the harvests done by farmers and their respective animal assets
- Graphing support for the real time visualization of data through Chart.js and JSON API provided by farmOS data model
- Support for switching between different graphing tools like bar chart and pie chart
- Timestamp filtering which interacts with the farmOS data model and processes that data to visualize through charts, this enables the user to filter data between various time stamps

## Challanges and Learnings:

- Adapting and understanding the whole Drupal ecosystem and how farmOS works in general
- Discussing and designing a solution that could be useful for everyone in the community
- Trying different approches, implementing them and discussing with mentors about their pros and cons
- Keeping code quality high and breaking different modules and utilities as much as possible into reusable components so that the project can be easily improved or expanded in the future

## Suggested Improvements:

- For now there is only support for visualizing harvest and animal asset data in these modules, for future this can be expanded to other logs and assets present in the farmOS as well
- Adding support for multiple other visualization tools other than bar chart and pie chart, which are easily interpretable and understandable by the users
- For now these modules are capable of only representing data in a specific way, that is fetched from the farmOS data model, In the future work can be done to make it more generalized so that people can connect other data sources as well and use it to make great visuals
